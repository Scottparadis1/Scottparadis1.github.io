## Branching and Releases

#### Branches ####

A widget should only be merged with the Master branch if it has been tested is ready to be used with the current released version of Web App Builder and ready for release.

#### Releases ####

Releases are created for the following reasons:
- A new version of Web App Builder has been released.
- A widget (or set of widgets) has been released or updated on the solutions website
